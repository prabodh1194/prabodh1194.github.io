	<h2>Synthesis of Hollow MSN &#8594; AT A GLANCE</h2>
	<p>Hollow Mesoporous silica nanoparticles are produced first by depositing a mixture of CTAC and TEOS on a hard sphere of dSiO<sub>2</sub>. Then the hard central dSiO<sub>2</sub> sphere was removed via a Na<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>based etching process. Characterization is done via SEM/TEM and pore size analysis via BET and BJH methods.Modulation of the cavity size can be done by changing the size of dSiO<sub>2</sub> hard sphere. For changing the pore size, the only possible option seems to be that of changing the ratio CTAC vs TEOS in the reaction mixture, although the same needs to be confirmed via proper experimentation.</p>

				<h3>AT A GLANCE</h3>
				<p>Adsorption of DNA on dSiO<sub>2</sub> nanoparticles is based on three driving forces:
					<ul>
						<li>Electrostatic Screening effect</li>
						<li>Dehydration Effect</li>
						<li>Generation of intermolecular hydrogen bonds</li>
					</ul>
					
				DNA being negative charged can't come in direct contact with these nanoparticles, hence methods employed aim at reducing the repulsion due to negative charges. Guanidine-HCl salt provide the cations used to reduce these electrostatic effects.The sorbent and the adsorbent can be hindered due to water. Guanidine-HCl is a chaotropic salt and captures water molecules thereby dehydrating DNA and reduce water bound to the sorbent and adsorbent surfaces. This step increases adsorption capacity of the adsorbent.DNA adsorbs on silica by the means of intermolecular H-bonding between the phosphate groups of the DNA backbone and the silanol groups of silica surface. Low pH is required for protonation of silanol and phosphate. pH is important for intermolecular H-bonding.These are negatively charged particles.</p>

				<h3>Overview</h3>
				<p>The adsorbtion of protein onto the silica nanoparticle surface depends on a number of factors, primarily pH, Ion strength of incubation solution and temperature. The pH mainly affects the adsorbtion process. It affects the surface charge of the protein. The pH of the solution must lie between the point of zero charge of the silica and the isoelectric point of the protein causing the two to have opposite charges. So, the following method will be adopted to check the conditions of maximum adsorbtion onto the silica nanoparticle.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h3>Procedure</h3>
				<ol>
					<li>Three solutions containing different conditions of pH were prepared. One will be a pH that lies between the pzc of the silica nanoparticle and isoelectric point of the protein (pH ~ 4.5-55). One will be the standard buffer conditions of storage of the T7 RNA Pol(20 mM Tris-HCl, 100 mM NaCl, 0.1 mM EDTA, 1 mM DTT, 50% Glycerol, pH 7.5 @ 25°C) . Also, one other pH of 6 was selected to study the effect of pH in more detail.</li>
					<li>Then, the adsorbtion was measured at different points of time at intervals of 1 minute for the first 15 minutes as the process of adsorbtion when the charges are opposite is expected to be instantaneous. However, to elucidate the adsorbtion process the adsorbtion was measured at intervals of one hour after that for a period of 5 hours and further if necessary.The adsorbtion will be studied by the technique mentioned in the following section of this document.</li>
					<li>Another important study will be the study of the activity of the enzyme once adsorbed. The adsorbtion conditions may affect the protein’s activity positively or negatively meaning that even if the adsorbtion may be less at some conditions, its activity at some condition may be more, resulting in a higher yield of the reaction product(in this case RNA). The activity studies will also be carried out as per procedure mentioned in this document.</li></li>
					<li>Once these studies are made the conditions resulting in the most significant amount of RNA production will be selected as the optimum conditions after ensuring that there is no error in experimental techniques and analysis.</li>
